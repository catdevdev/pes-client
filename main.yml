can you build github ci file
that build docker container `docker build -t pes-client .`
and run it with `docker run -p 1997:1997 pes-client`
and build and run and rebuild and rerun it after every push on master
and also send message to telegram group that
1) container is building
2) container finished building, otherwise container is failed building
3) container is deployed, otherwise container is failed to deployed
make funny messages about it with dog topic
